# Drone OSD

## How to use OSD

To activate OSD menu in your Goggles, do this stick combination:

```
mid throttle
yaw left
pitch forward
```

Your __throttle__ would have to __remain at__ around the __middle__ throughout the operation.

From here you can __scroll__ through the menu with the __pitch stick__, use __roll stick to select__ options. Values can be __changed with your roll stick__.

To __save and exit__, simply __YAW RIGHT__.

To go back to __the last menu, YAW LEFT__.
